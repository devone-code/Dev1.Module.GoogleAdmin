# Dev1.Module.GoogleAdmin

This is an example (although still usefull) GoogleAdmin module for the Oqtane Frmework.

This was initially created as a demonstration of how to create custom Input types see 'GoogleAddressInputType' for the Dev1.QandA (Questions and Answers) Oqtane module,
as well as Custom Flow Actions for the Dev1.Flow Oqtane module (see FlowActions in the server project).

It also includes a module for setting Google Admin API keys, and a Calendar Module for displaying google Calendars.

PLEASE NOTE: For this module, and the associated Flow Actions, to work, you must have Google OAuth enabled in your Oqtane application as it uses
the Oauth tokens to access the google API's.
